## Some cool projects

* [Tanukeys](https://github.com/n1nj4t4nuk1/tanukeys) - Service for storing public keys of users for various purposes such as message signature verification, encrypting information for a specific user, storing cryptocurrency wallet addresses, and simplifying key exchanges between devices.

* [Deepfinder](https://pypi.org/project/deepfinder/) - Search attributes easily using dot paths. Within structures of type dictionary, list and embedded substructures with simple format 'dict.users.0.name'.

* [Python DDD Skeleton](https://github.com/n1nj4t4nuk1/python-ddd-skeleton) - Template of a Python & FastAPI application using Domain-Driven Design and Command Query Response Segregation principles.

## Publications

* [Digital Twin for Adaptive Adversary Emulation in IIoT Control Networks](doi.org/10.1007/978-3-032-07894-0_22) - The paper proposes using digital twins and reinforcement learning–based adaptive adversaries to safely test and improve the security of industrial systems. It presents a methodology combining control theory and centrality analysis to automate and validate adversarial attacks in virtualized critical environments.
